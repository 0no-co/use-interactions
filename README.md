React hooks for accessible, common web interactions. **UI super powers without the UI.**

`use-interactions` is an experimental and incomplete collection of utility hooks to selectively provide accessible behaviours, animations, and other tricky interactions that would otherwise slow you down when building an accessible application. All UI and styling is up to you and ARIA authoring is only based on advice.

## Development

1. Install deps with `yarn install`
2. Run tests with `yarn test`
3. Alternatively, you can use `yarn test:open` to run Cypress UI, where you can visual see the browser running tests so they can be easier to debug.

We use [Cypress component testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/writing-your-first-component-test), and this is how we develop and test the react hooks offered by this library.
